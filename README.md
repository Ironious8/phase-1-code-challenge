# Topic:Code challenges

# Purpose
To complete the code challenges assigned by creating programs that will
accomplish the given functions


# Setting up the enviroment
Set up the coding environment through these steps:
 1. Create a github repository for rhe assignment.
 2. Create a directory for the assignments.(mkdir folder name)
 3. Create three files each for working on the three questions.(touch file.txt)
 4. Get started on the assignments.


# Structure
The structure of this directory is as follows:
1. grade.js
2. README.md
3. salary.js
4. speed.js


# Procedure
Here we start of with the first code challenge which is creating a program that will prompt a user to input their marks , validate their inputs and assign grades to their respective marks.

Thereafter we move to the second code challenge which is creating a program that will prompt a user to input their speed, validate their inputs and receive an ok when they are below the speed limit and receive demerit points when they are above the speed limit by every 5km/h.

Finally we move to the third and final code challenge which is creating a program that calculates the net salary of an individual while factoring in the gross salary which undergoes deductions like NHIF and NSSF.


# Working through errors
The codes should be run through the terminal or through the console in the browser in order to confirm whether the codes are working.If they are not working, the terminal and console should display the errors in the codes which should give clues on how to rectify the errors.


# Submitting work done
After finishing the code challenges, the following should be done:
1. Save your changes
2. Link your local repository with your remote repository(git remote add origin).
3. Add your files(git add .)
4. Commit your changes(git commit -m "message")
5. Push your changes to the remote repository(git push origin branch name)

After finishing these steps you should see your updates changes in your github profile.
 
Before we forget,the work is to be submitted to canvas. Simply paste the URL of the work in the submission section of the code challenge and click on submit assignment.

That's pretty much it! The code challenges have been successfully completed and submitted!
